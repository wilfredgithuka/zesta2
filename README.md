The zesta series is a project that changes the look of laptop chargers from the common cuboid
black boxes into a more appealing design.

zesta2 is improvement of the first zesta project. This will be a complete
make-from-scratch laptop power supply module. The zesta project which I currently use works
well but due to the parts not made by me, there is so much constraints that I am facing.

The result is just to make my own power supply/laptop charger from scratch. I will be in
control of the specs and most important, the design. Also I will add some culture to the
charger to make it more Kenyan. The charger shall still be housed in a zesta jam can.

The device shall have an input of AC 240V and output a clean regulated DC 19.5V

The main objective from this project is to understand how Swiched Mode Power Supply devices work.

## Tools

* Fritzing

## Materials

* (Will be added soon)

## Safety First

* This circuit Involves in operating  High voltage AC it is lethal, Handle with extreme care
* Make the Flyback transformer as your requirement or get a ready made one.
* If you are construct your own Flyback transformer, then check the operation of the device before fetch into circuit.
* Again, All stages in SMPS circuit involved in operation of High voltage either AC or DC, Handle with extreme care     and protections.
