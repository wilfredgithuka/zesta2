The zesta series is a project that changes the look of laptop chargers from the common cuboid
black boxes into a more appealing design.

zesta2 is improvement of the first zesta project. This will be a complete
make-from-scratch laptop power supply module. The zesta project which I currently use works
well but due to the parts not made by me, there is so much constraints that I am facing.

The result is just to make my own power supply/laptop charger from scratch. I will be in
control of the specs and most important, the design. Also I will add some culture to the
charger to make it more Kenyan. The charger shall still be housed in a zesta jam can.

The device shall have an input of AC 240V and output a clean regulated DC 19.5V

The main objective from this project is to understand how Swiched Mode Power Supply devices work.

Zesta系列是一个改变笔记本电脑充电器外观的项目黑盒设计更具吸引力。Zesta2是第一个Zesta项目的改进。这将是一个完整的
从头开电脑电源模块。我目前使用的Zesta项目但由于这些零件不是我自己做的，所以我面临着很多限制。

这样做的结果仅仅是为了让我自己的电源/笔记本电脑充电器从头开始。我会在规范的控制，最重要的是设计。另外，我会在

充电器使它更肯尼亚的文化。充电器仍应装在Zesta果酱罐中。该装置的输入电压应为240V，输出电压应为19.5V的干净调节直流电。

本项目的主要目标是了解开关电源设备的工作原理。

## Tools 工具

* Fritzing - PCB Design tool 12MB [yay -S fritzing]

## Materials 材料

* (Will be added soon)

## Safety First 安全知识

* This circuit Involves in operating  High voltage AC it is lethal, Handle with extreme care
* Make the Flyback transformer as your requirement or get a ready made one.
* If you are construct your own Flyback transformer, then check the operation of the device before fetch into circuit.
* Again, All stages in SMPS circuit involved in operation of High voltage either AC or DC, Handle with extreme care     and protections.
